       "In this lesson, I learned how to create a simple Python function to add two integers. This exercise taught me the importance of defining functions and how they can help break down complex problems into simpler tasks. I also learned to handle inputs and outputs effectively. My code successfully printed the sum of two numbers, showcasing how basic arithmetic can be implemented in programming.\n",

       "This lesson focused on calculating the factorial of a number and identifying numbers divisible by 2. I implemented a recursive function to compute the factorial, which helped deepen my understanding of recursion. Additionally, I learned how to filter lists in Python using list comprehensions. It was fascinating to see how quickly numbers can grow when calculating factorials, and how easily we can find specific values in a list.\n",

       "In this part of my homework, I worked with JSON to create and manipulate dictionaries in JavaScript. I learned how to parse JSON strings and update items within an object. This exercise highlighted the importance of data structures in programming and how they can be used to store and retrieve information efficiently. I found it interesting to see the connection between JSON and JavaScript objects, reinforcing the concept of structured data.\n",
